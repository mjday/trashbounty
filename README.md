## General info

According to [estimates](https://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/financial-inclusion-asias-unbanked) by the World Bank, more than 70% of the population of South East Asia are unbanked. At the same time, accessibility to smart phones and rates of mobile phone usage in the region are amongst the highest across the globe. At the same time the SEA region is estimated to account for more than half of plastic waste that enters the ocean.

Trash Bounty uses Bitcoin to incentive both the collection of recyclable plastics and the subsequent delivery to neighbouring recycling centres.

Trash Bounty is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), and is designed to be used in regions with little to no internet access.
